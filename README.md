# webscraper-mongodb
This webscraper scrapes news from https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev and displays the titles of the articles from that site with their links. Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Request, and Cheerio are used to get articles and have the article information and the notes persist.

Checkout [https://webscraper-mongodb.herokuapp.com/index](https://webscraper-mongodb.herokuapp.com/index) to view a demo of the application.  You can click on an article title and add or delete a note about the article.
